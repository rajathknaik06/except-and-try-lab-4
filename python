""" Write a program to obtain the cost for 'n' days of an item and use n as input to calculate the cost per day for the item. In case, zero is given as input for n, an arithmetic exception is thrown; handle the exception and prompt the user accordingly with an error message 'Division by Zero'.

Input format :
The first line of the input consists of a float representing the cost of the item for n days.

The second line of the input consists of an integer representing the number of days.

Output format :
If the number of days is greater than zero, the output shows the cost of one day.

Otherwise, displays 'Division by Zero'."""

cost = float(input())
#Number of days

try:
    div = cost / n
    print(div)
